As for the trained models of AdaIN, you can download from the cloud disk [AdaIN-models](https://disk.pku.edu.cn:443/link/F212AA16F0ECC045040A457B28DC65DD) 
with password `EpHy`. Since the released pytorch version is 0.4.0 and our adopted version is 1.1.0, we resave the model from `*.t7` to `*.pth` (from torch to pytorch).
